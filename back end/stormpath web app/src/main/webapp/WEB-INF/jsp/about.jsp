Body:

Our elegant venues support an enormous variety of activities for all ages and demographics. Extravagent parties, formal business meetings, or dazzling weddings â€” we are committed to providing our valued customers with the highest grade of services.

Converge Incorperation was founded in 2015 by Darren Kopa, Daniel Lin and Forest Yang with the sole purpose of building a banquet hall service with the integration of an e-commerce website. Today, the company's fundamental goals and ideals have remained unchanged, continuing its mission to provide its patrons with services of the utmost quality.

We offer unprecedented services to our customers, including an irresistable assortment of hors d'oeuvre and drinks, a 50-foot ballroom and world-class attendents ready to address your needs and wants. Our most distinuishing feature to date, however, is our widely acclaimed website, which gives customers a chance to reserve their event in advance without the hassle of picking up the phone or filling out convoluted paperwork. Converge wanted to give its customers a quick and easy process for creating reservations, so its founders built a powerful, no-frills website to complete just that.

Our Mission:

Our trail starts with our mission, which we uphold with the greatest care and passion. It declares our objective as a company and serves as the standard of comparison for our actions and choices.
